# StringCombiner

This program is provided for new and future students that will be attending MCC. This program will allow the new student to enter in their first name, middle initial, last name, student number and attended high school.
Once all information has been entered, the program will then create a unique password for that student.
The password is comprised of three letters from the students first, last name and the last four digits of their student number.
This program may be executed from the command line or executed as part of a batch file.

Learned:
1. stcat and strcpy
2. Char array to accommodate longer fields
3. How to get a program to read from another file to allow the code to process and output correctly.
